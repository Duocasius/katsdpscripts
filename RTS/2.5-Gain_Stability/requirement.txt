the obs is a track of the SCP with Noise-diodes firing.
The reduction produces plots and numbers/stats about the stability of the system.

The requirements R.T.P.6 & R.RC.P.30 are relevent to this test. 

R.RC.P.30  refines: R.T.P.6
R.RC.P.30  is verified by: Receptor Gain Stability
R.RC.P.30  is categorized by: R.T.RFI02, R.T.RFI03

Here are the details:

R.T.P.6: Under normal operating conditions, gain changes from receiver electronics and processing shall be limited to < 2% RMS over 20 minutes.

R.RC.P.30: Under normal operating conditions and in the presence of RFI as described by  R.T.RFI02 and R.T.RFI03, the standard deviation of the receptor's system noise measurements shall be <= 2% RMS over 20 minutes, even when the telescope changes from a receiver to any other receiver and then back.

R.T.RFI.2: The receiver system of the MeerKAT Telescope shall remain linear in the presence of spaceborne RFI, defined with respect to the 1% compression point, assuming a maximum RF signal strength from satellites of -117 dBm, as received by a linearly polarised 0 dBi antenna.

R.T.RFI.3: The receiver system of the MeerKAT Telescope shall remain linear in the presence of airborne RFI, defined with respect to the 1% compression point, generated by aircraft at a range of 50 km or more.
